Docker Installation (Windows) - Simple Steps

1) Download Docker Desktop
   - Open your browser and search for: "Docker Desktop for Windows"
   from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
   - Download the installer from Docker's official website.

2) Install Docker Desktop
   - Run the installer you downloaded.
   - When asked, allow it to install required components (WSL2).

3) Turn on WSL2 (first time only)
   - Docker Desktop will guide you if WSL2 is missing.
   - If prompted, allow installation and restart your computer.

4) Start Docker Desktop
   - Open Docker Desktop from the Start Menu.
   - Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running".

Run this project with Docker

1) Open the project folder
   - Find the folder that contains this file.

2) Open PowerShell in the folder
   - Hold Shift and right‑click inside the folder.
   - Choose "Open PowerShell window here" (or "Open in Terminal").

3) Start the app
   - Type:
     docker compose up --build

4) Open the app
   - In your browser, open:
     http://localhost:8000

Stop the app

- Press Ctrl+C in the PowerShell window.
- Then type:
  docker compose down

If port 8000 is already in use

- Open docker-compose.yml and change:
  "8000:8000" to "8001:8000"
- Run again and open:
  http://localhost:8001

Need help?

- If Docker says it needs WSL2, follow its prompts and restart.
- If you see errors about PDFs, Poppler is already included in the Docker image.
